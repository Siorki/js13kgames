**2048 / 13** is my entry for [js13kgames edition 2024](https://dev.js13kgames.com/2024/games)

## TO PLAY
It is a puzzle game that would play pretty much like a 2048 ...
... if multiples of 13 were not there to thwart your attempts.

Each time you get 8 4 and 1 side by side, they fuse into a 13.

Play with keyboard, mouse or touch screen.

##Â TO BUILD

The build performed using the command line.

Edit build/buildAll.sh and edit lines 2 and 5 :
 - CURRENT_REVISION is a command that returns a unique number for the current revision. For git, you can use `$(git rev-parse HEAD)` or improve the script to generate an ever-increasing identifier.
 - JSMIN_DIR is the path to a local install of jsMin, the minifier tool by Douglas Crockford
 
then run `build\buildAll.sh`

The output is located in `dist\${BUILD_NUMBER}`
