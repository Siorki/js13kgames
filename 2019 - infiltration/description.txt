- Master, here are the plans of the Death Cube. We can fire a torpedo into this exhaust vent, going straight to the reactor core.  This is our only chance.
- Padawan, this is 2019. Let's send an unmanned drone into the main entrance, cloak it so that the Cube's defences will ignore it, and remote control it until it reaches the reactor.
- But master, how can we avoid all the obstacles inside and still reach our destination ?
- Easy, easy. If anything goes wrong, use the Force to send the spacecraft back in time.
- Back in time ? Is that even possible ?
